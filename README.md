# jinon_study_repo

Just some repo for my DevOps/SRE/Coding studying.
Here i will be sharing some scripts/codes for storaging my studying progress.

Something about me (except information above...): studying in Netology at the DevOps Course (wow, who might guess...) and working as the Lead Engineer of Planning and Expanding DC's IP Network at Russian Mobile Network Operator.

Here is some sausage with salad by the way...
